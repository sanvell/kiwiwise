                    <p className="lead">When planning for retirement, it’s tempting to assume a modest balance will be enough. But research suggests that couples in New Zealand may need up to $1.2 million for a comfortable retirement. Are your expectations realistic?</p>
                    
                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Breaking Down the Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Lifestyle costs, housing expenses, and inflation all contribute to a higher-than-expected retirement price tag. Even with a paid-off home, maintenance, insurance, and daily costs continue.</p>

                        <li><strong>Modest Retirement:</strong> $600k–$800k could support a comfortable, low-key lifestyle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Active Lifestyle:</strong> $1M–$1.2M needed for travel, hobbies, and flexibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Luxury Retirement:</strong> More than $1.5M if expecting international travel and high discretionary spending.</li>
                    </ul>
